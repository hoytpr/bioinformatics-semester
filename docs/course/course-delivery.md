### Flipped Classroom

In a Flipped Classroom, students are assigned [`readings/`]({{ site.baseurl }}/readings) prior to class with a focus on [`exercises/`]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises) and [`assignments/`]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments) in class. [`lectures/`]({{ site.baseurl }}/lectures) are  designed to be brief and serve to motivate the 
activity for the class. This course can use a flipped, learner-centered, approach 
because learning to program is most effective when students are actively working 
with computers. Flipped classes work well for all kinds of content, but they 
work particularly well for computer oriented classes. 


### Workshop In-class Format

When this course is used as a flipped classroom, some motivation and re-
exposure to the ideas from the [`readings/`]({{ site.baseurl }}/readings) is 
beneficial. This is because multiple key topics are more effectively introduced 
separately, where a brief introduction to one of the key topics is followed by 
the students completing an [`exercise`]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises) on that topic. Depending on the length of the [`assignment`]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments) and class sessions this could be repeated 2-3 times to cover key topics. Structure for this strategy is included for some Shell and R ;essons in [`lectures/`]({{ site.baseurl }}/lectures) and [`materials/`]({{ site.baseurl }}/materials).
