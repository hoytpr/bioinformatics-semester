### Starting Genomics

Command line interface (OS shell) and graphic user interface (GUI) are different ways of interacting with a computer’s operating system. The shell is a program that presents a command line interface which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination.

We will begin by setting you up for the next lessons. As you progress through this lesson, keep in mind that even if you aren’t going to be doing this exact same workflow in your research, you will be learning some very important lessons about using command-line bioinformatics tools. What you learn here will enable you to use a variety of bioinformatic tools with confidence and greatly enhance your research efficiency and productivity.

### Using a terminal to access Cowboy

Linux and Mac users have terminals built-in, but Windows users need to [install Putty](https://hpcc.okstate.edu/content/logging-cowboy).
