**Disclaimer:** These software are almost obsolete. They really are! 
But we are using them to demonstrate 
the processes used in genomics. We want you to know you can do this!
If we used the most modern software, 
they would change six times before the semester 
completed! We strongly encourage you to find better software 
if you plan to use assemblers and RNA-Seq in your own experiments.
For a discussion of scientists using outdated software see this 
2018 article [Scientists Continue to Use Outdated Methods](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/scientists-continue-to-use-outdated-methods-30438)

Here's a more recent article which coins the term ["Software collapse"](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02117588)

### Readings

- Awesome information about the Cowboy supercomputer can be found [at the OSU HPCC Website](https://hpcc.okstate.edu/content/logging-cowboy)
- Fantastic information about starting to use an HPC can be found (of course!) at the [Carpentries Website](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-intro/)
- Tons of information at the home site for the [SPAdes assembler](https://isugenomics.github.io/bioinformatics-workbook/dataAnalysis/GenomeAssembly/Assemblers/spades.html)
- Info on the old but good [Velvet assembler](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/)
- [Soapdenovo2](https://github.com/aquaskyline/SOAPdenovo2) is also an older assembler, but it's easy to use and gets the point across.
- Even more awesomeness to come soon!
