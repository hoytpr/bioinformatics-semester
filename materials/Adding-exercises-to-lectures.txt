In the materials folder 
genomics-variant-calling-workflow.md could have:

**[Do the In-class Exercises 1 and 2 by clicking on this link.]({{site.baseurl}}/exercises/Genomics-variant-calling-workflow-Shell)**
Work on the questions yourself, 
before looking at the answers (take about 5 minutes).

************************
EXTANT in the:
\exercises\Genomics-variant-calling-workflow-Shell.md

---
layout: exercise
topic: Genomics
title: Variant Calling Workflow
language: Shell

Could use: \exercises\Genomics-variant-calling-workflow-1-Shell.md
\exercises\Genomics-variant-calling-workflow-2-Shell.md

But YAML also needs to say:
title: Variant Calling Workflow 1
title: Variant Calling Workflow 2

*************************************
**Exercise 1**

1 - What is the last read in the `SRR2584863_1.fastq` file? How confident
are you in this read? 

**Exercise 2**

2 - How big are the files?
(Hint: Look at the options for the `ls` command to see how to show
file sizes.)

EXTANT in:
Genomics-variant-calling-workflow-Shell.txt

bioinformatics-semester/solutions use multiple files:

Genomics-variant-calling-workflow-Shell-1.txt
Genomics-variant-calling-workflow-Shell-2.txt
