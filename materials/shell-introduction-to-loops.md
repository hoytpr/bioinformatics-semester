#### Writing 'for' loops

Loops are key to productivity improvements through automation as they allow us to execute commands repeatedly. 
Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the amount of typing (and typing mistakes). 
Loops are helpful when performing operations on groups of sequencing files, such as unzipping or trimming multiple
files. We will use loops for these purposes in subsequent analyses, but will cover the basics of them for now.

When the shell sees the keyword `for`, it knows to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each item in a list. 
Each time the loop runs (called an iteration), an item in the list is assigned in sequence to the **variable**, and 
the commands inside the loop are executed, before moving on to  the next item in the list. Inside the loop, we call for 
the variable's value by putting `$` in front of it. The `$` tells the shell interpreter to treat the **variable**
as a variable name and substitute its value in its place, rather than treat it as text or an external command. 

Let's write a for loop to show us the first two lines of the fastq files we downloaded earlier. You will notice shell prompt changes from `$` to `>` and back again as we were typing in our loop. The second prompt, `>`, is different to remind us that we haven’t finished typing a complete command yet. A semicolon, `;`, can be used to separate two commands written on a single line.

~~~
$ cd ../untrimmed_fastq/
$ for filename in *.fastq
> do
> head -n 2 ${filename}
> done
~~~

The for loop begins with the formula `for <variable> in <group to iterate over>`. In this case, the word `filename` is designated 
as the variable to be used over each iteration. In our case `SRR097977.fastq` and `SRR098026.fastq` will be substituted for `filename` 
because they fit the pattern of ending with .fastq in directory we've specified. The next line of the for loop is `do`. The next line is 
the code that we want to execute. We are telling the loop to print the first two lines of each variable we iterate over. Finally, the
word `done` ends the loop.

After executing the loop, you should see the first two lines of both fastq files printed to the terminal. Let's create a loop that 
will save this information to a file.

~~~
$ for filename in *.fastq
> do
> head -n 2 ${filename} >> seq_info.txt
> done
~~~

Note that we are using `>>` to append the text to our `seq_info.txt` file. If we used `>`, the `seq_info.txt` file would be rewritten
every time the loop iterates, so it would only have text from the last variable used. Instead, `>>` adds to the end of the file.

## Using Basename in 'for' loops
`basename` is a function in UNIX that is helpful for removing a uniform part of a name from a list of files. In this case, we will use `basename` to remove the `.fastq` extension from the files that we’ve been working with. 

~~~
$ basename SRR097977.fastq .fastq
~~~

We see that this returns just the SRR accession, and no longer has the .fastq file extension on it.

~~~
SRR097977
~~~

If we try the same thing but use `.fasta` as the file extension instead, nothing happens. This is because basename only works when it exactly matches a string in the file.

~~~
$ basename SRR097977.fastq .fasta
SRR097977.fastq
~~~

Basename is really powerful when used in a 'for' loop. It allows to access just the file prefix, which you can use to name things. Let's try this.

Inside our 'for' loop, we create a new variable name. We call the basename function inside the parenthesis, then give our variable name from the for loop, in this case `${filename}`, and finally state that `.fastq` should be removed from the file name. It’s important to note that we’re not changing the actual files, we’re creating a new variable called `name`. The line `> echo ${name}` will print to the terminal the variable name each time the for loop runs. Because we are iterating over two files, we expect to see two lines of output.

~~~
$ for filename in *.fastq
> do
> name=$(basename ${filename} .fastq)
> echo ${name}
> done
~~~
