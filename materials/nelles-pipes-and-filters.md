### Nelle's Pipeline: Checking Files

Nelle has run her samples through the assay machines
and created 17 files in the `north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03` directory described earlier.
As a quick sanity check, starting from her home directory, Nelle types:

~~~
$ cd north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03
$ wc -l *.txt
~~~

The output is 18 lines that look like this:

~~~
300 NENE01729A.txt
300 NENE01729B.txt
300 NENE01736A.txt
300 NENE01751A.txt
300 NENE01751B.txt
300 NENE01812A.txt
... ...
~~~

Now she types this:

~~~
$ wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -n 5
 240 NENE02018B.txt
 300 NENE01729A.txt
 300 NENE01729B.txt
 300 NENE01736A.txt
 300 NENE01751A.txt
~~~

Whoops: one of the files is 60 lines shorter than the others.
When she goes back and checks it,
she sees that she did that assay at 8:00 on a Monday morning --- someone
was probably in using the machine on the weekend,
and she forgot to reset it.
Before re-running that sample,
she checks to see if any files have too much data:

~~~
$ wc -l *.txt | sort -n | tail -n 5
 300 NENE02040B.txt
 300 NENE02040Z.txt
 300 NENE02043A.txt
 300 NENE02043B.txt
5040 total
~~~

Those numbers look good --- but what's that 'Z' doing there in the third-to-last line?
All of her samples should be marked 'A' or 'B';
by convention,
her lab uses 'Z' to indicate samples with missing information.
To find others like it, she does this:

~~~
$ ls *Z.txt
NENE01971Z.txt    NENE02040Z.txt
~~~

Sure enough,
when she checks the log on her laptop,
there's no depth recorded for either of those samples.
Since it's too late to get the information any other way,
she must exclude those two files from her analysis.
She could just delete them using `rm`,
but there are actually some analyses she might do later where depth doesn't matter,
so instead, she'll just be careful to select files using the wildcard expression `*[AB].txt`.
As always,
the `*` matches any number of characters;
the expression `[AB]` matches either an 'A' or a 'B',
so this matches all the valid data files she has.

### Wildcard Expressions

Wildcard expressions can be very complex, but you can sometimes write
them using simple syntax. 
 
Consider the directory `data-shell/north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03` :
the wildcard expression `*[AB].txt`
matches all files ending in `A.txt` or `B.txt`. Imagine you forgot about
this.

> 	$ ls *A.txt
> 	$ ls *B.txt
> 	```
> 2. The output from the new commands is separated because there are two commands.
> 3. When there are no files ending in `A.txt`, or there are no files ending in
> `B.txt`.

### Removing Unneeded Files

Suppose you want to delete your processed data files, and only keep
your raw files and processing script to save storage.
The raw files end in `.dat` and the processed files end in `.txt`.

> Which of the following would remove all the processed data files,
> and *only* the processed data files?
>
> 1. `rm ?.txt`
> 2. `rm *.txt`
> 3. `rm * .txt`
> 4. `rm *.*`
>
> #### Solution
> 1. (No) This would remove `.txt` files with one-character names
> 2. This is correct answer
> 3. (No) The shell would expand `*` to match everything in the current directory,
> so the command would try to remove all matched files and an additional
> file called `.txt`
> 4. (No!) The shell would expand `*.*` to match all files with any extension,
> so this command would delete **all** files
