### Getting ready to use R for the first time

In this lesson we will take you through the very first things you need to get
R working.

-->

### Advantages of using R

At more than 20 years old, R is fairly mature and [growing in popularity](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/r/). However, programming isnâ€™t a popularity contest. Here are key advantages of
analyzing data in R:

 - **R is [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)**.
   This means R is free - an advantage if you are at an institution where you
   have to pay for your own MATLAB or SAS license. Open source, is important to
   your colleagues in parts of the world where expensive software is
   inaccessible. It also means that R is actively developed by a community (see
   [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/)),
   and there are regular updates.
 - **R is widely used**. Ok, maybe programming is a popularity contest. Because
   R is used in many disciplines (not just bioinformatics), you are more likely to
   find help online when you need it. Chances are, almost any error message you
   run into, someone else has already experienced.
- **R is powerful**. R runs on multiple platforms (Windows/MacOS/Linux). It can
   work with much larger datasets than popular spreadsheet programs like
   Microsoft Excel, and because of its scripting capabilities is far more
   reproducible. Also, there are thousands of available software packages for
   science, particulaly statistics, data analyses, genomics
   and other areas of life science.

> ## Tip: This lesson works best on the cloud
>
> Remember, these lessons assume we are using the pre-configured virtual machine
> instances provided to you at a genomics workshop. Much of this work could be
> done on your laptop, but we use instances to simplify workshop setup
> requirements, and to get you familiar with using the cloud (a common
> requirement for working with big data).
> Visit the [Genomics Workshop setup page](http://www.datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/setup.html)
> for details on getting this instance running on your own, or for the info you
> need to do this on your own computer.

### Log on to RStudio Server

Open a web browser and enter the IP address of your instance 
(provided by your instructors), followed by
`:8787`. For example, if your IP address was 123.45.67.89 your URL would be

```
http://123.45.67.89:8787
```

> #### Tip: Make sure there are no spaces before or after your URL or
> your web browser may interpret it as a search query.

You should now be looking at a page that will allow you to login to the RStudio
server:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/rstudio_login_screen.png)

Enter your user credentials and click <kbd>Sign In</kbd>. The credentials for
the genomics Data Carpentry instances will be provided by your instructors. 

You should now see the RStudio interface:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/rstudio_session_default.png)


### RStudio

In these lessons, we will be making use of a software called [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) that runs R inside an IDE (an
Integrated Development Environment), which operates a little like a GUI.

* Advantages:
    * The Interpreter/Console has multiple visualization panes
    * There is a Text editor that includes:
        * object-specific highlighting (easier to read)
        * provides __information__ about problems with code (easier to understand)
        * `tab` key __autocompletes__ (easy to work with)
            * Let the computer do repetitious work. 
            * It makes fewer mistakes.
    * The Environment/History functions allow you to reproduce/troubleshoot something done before
    * The Project management functions keep things separate and **transferable**
	
### Create an RStudio project

One of the first benefits we will take advantage of in RStudio is the
Project management, by creating something
called an **RStudio Project**. An RStudio project allows you to more easily:

- Save data, files, variables, packages, etc. related to a specific
  analysis project
- Restart work where you left off
- Collaborate, especially if you are using version control such as [git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).

1. To create a project, go to the <kbd>File</kbd> menu, and click <kbd>New Project...</kbd>.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/new_project_window.png)

2. In the window that opens select **New Directory**, then **New Project**. For
"Directory name:" enter **dc_genomics_r**. For "Create project as subdirectory of",
you may leave the default, which is your home directory "~".

3. **Packrat** check off "**Use packrat with this project**" and follow any
installation instructions. See the **Tip** below.

4. Finally click <kbd>Create Project</kbd>. In the "Files" tab of your output
pane (more about the RStudio layout in a moment), you should see an RStudio
 project file, **dc_genomics_r.Rproj**. All RStudio projects end with the
 "**.Rproj**" file extension.

>### Tip: Make your project more reproducible with Packrat
> One of the most wonderful and also frustrating aspects of working with R is
> managing **packages**. We will talk more about them, but packages (e.g. ggplot2)
> are ***add-ons that extend what you can do with R***. Unfortunately it is very
> common to encounter versions of R and/or R packages that are not
> compatible. This makes it difficult for someone to with a different 
> version of R or the R Packakge to run your R scripts. 
> it's likewise more difficult to run
> their scripts on your machine. [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/)
> is an RStudio add-on (like a package) that will associate your packages 
> with your project so that
> your work is more portable and reproducible. To turn on Packrat click on
> the <KBD>Tools</KBD> menu and select <KBD>Project Options</KBD>.

### Creating your first R script

Now that we are ready to start exploring R, we will want to keep a record of the
commands we are using. To do this we can create an R script:

Click the <kbd>File</kbd> menu and select <kbd>New File</kbd> and then
<kbd>R Script</kbd>. Before we go any further, save your script by clicking the
save/disk icon that is in the bar above the first line in the script editor, or
click the <kbd>File</kbd> menu and select <kbd>save</kbd>. In the "Save File"
window that opens, name your file **"genomics_r_basics"**. The new script
**genomics_r_basics.R** should appear under "files" in the output pane. By
convention, R scripts end with the file extension **.R**.

### Overview and customization of the RStudio layout

Although yours may be arranged differently, Here are the major windows (or panes) of the    
**RStudio environment:**

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/rstudio_session_4pane_layout.png)

- **Source**: IMPORTANT!!  This pane is where you will write/view R scripts. Some outputs
  (such as if you view a dataset using `View()`) will appear as a tab here.
- **Console/Terminal**: This is actually where you see the execution of
  commands. This is the same display you would see if you were using R at the
  command line without RStudio. You can (but we won't) work interactively (i.e. enter R
  commands here), but for the most part we will run a script (or lines in a
  script) in the ***Source*** pane and watch their execution and output in the ***Console***. 
  The "Terminal" tab gives you access to the BASH terminal (the Linux operating
  system, unrelated to R).
- **Environment/History**: Here, RStudio will show you what datasets and
  objects (variables) you have created and which are defined in memory.
  You can also see some properties of objects/datasets such as their type
  and dimensions. The "History" tab contains a history of the R commands you've executed R.
- **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer**: This multipurpose pane will show you the
  contents of directories on your computer. You can also use the "Files" tab to
  navigate and set the working directory. The "Plots" tab will show the output
  of any plots generated. In "Packages" you will see what packages are actively
  loaded, or you can attach installed packages. "Help" will display help files
  for R functions and packages. RStudio includes a Viewer pane that can be used 
  to view local web content.

If your panes are arranged differently, you should probably go to the <KBD>View</KBD> menu, 
click on "Panes", and then make sure "Show All Panes" and "Console on Left" are 
checked. 

![Panes]({{ base.siteurl }}/fig/panes.png)

All of the panes in RStudio have configuration options. For example, you can
minimize/maximize a pane, or by moving your mouse in the space between
panes you can resize as needed. The most important customization options for
pane layout are in the <KBD>View</KBD> menu. Other options such as font sizes,
colors/themes, and more are in the <KBD>Tools</KBD> menu under
<KBD>Global Options</KBD>.

> ### Tip: Uploads and downloads in the cloud
> In the "Files" tab you can *select* a file and download it from your cloud
> instance (click the "more" button) to your local computer.
> Uploads are also possible.

> ### Yes, you are working with R!
> Although we won't be working with R at the *terminal*, you'll want to use only 
> the terminal eventually. For example, once you have written an RScript, you can run 
> it in any Linux, Mac or Windows terminal without the need to start up RStudio. 
> 
> So let's be clear: RStudio ***runs*** R, but R is not RStudio. For more on
> running an R Script at the terminal see this [Software Carpentry lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/05-cmdline/).


### Getting to work with R: navigating directories
Now that we have covered the more aesthetic aspects of RStudio, we can get to
work using some commands. We will write, execute, and save the commands we
learn in our **genomics_r_basics.R** script that we loaded in the Source pane.
First, lets see what directory we are in. To do so, click inside the Source
window, and type the following command into the script:

```
getwd()
```

To execute this command, make sure your cursor is on the same line the command
is written. Then click the <KBD>Run</KBD> button that is just above the first
line of your script in the header of the Source pane.


In the Console window, we expect to see the following output*:

~~~
[1] "/home/dcuser/dc_genomics_r"
~~~

\* Notice, at the Console, you will also see the instruction you executed
above the output in [blue]({{ site.baseurl}}/materials/r-intro/#blue)<a name="blue"></a>

We can predict this output when we are working on a defined system or instance 
such as AWS. If you are on a different machine, you might get a different directory as 
the default directory. For example:

```
[1] "C:/Users/Buddy/Desktop/R-testing/dc_genomics_r"
```


Since we will be learning several commands, we will want to keep some
short notes or "comments" in our script to explain the purpose of the 
command. Putting a `#` before any line in an R script turns that line 
into a comment, which R will not try to interpret as code. To get started, 
edit your script to include a comment on the purpose of commands you 
are learning, e.g.:

```
# this command shows the current working directory
getwd()
```
For the purposes of this exercise we want you to be in the directory `"/home/dcuser/R_data"`.
What if you weren't? You can set your home directory using the `setwd()`
command. Enter this comment and command in your script, but ***don't run*** this yet.

```
# This sets the working directory
setwd()
```

You may have guessed, you need to tell the `setwd()` command
what directory you want to set as your working directory. To do so, inside of
the parentheses, open a set of quotes. Inside the quotes enter a `/` which is
the root directory for Linux. Next, use the <KBD>Tab</KBD> key, to take
advantage of RStudio's Tab-autocompletion method, to select `home`, `dcuser`,
and `dc_genomics_r` directory. The path in your script should look like this:

```
# This sets the working directory
setwd("/home/dcuser/dc_genomics_r")
```

When you run this command, the console repeats the command, but gives you no
output. Instead, you see the blank R prompt: `>`. Congratulations! Although it
seems small, knowing what your working directory is and being able to set your
working directory is the first step to analyzing your data.

> ## Tip: Never use `setwd()`
>
> Wait, what was the last 2 minutes about? Well, setting your working directory
> is something you need to do, but not as
> a step in your script. For example, what if your script is on a computer
> that has a different directory structure? The top-level path in a Unix file
> system is root `/`, but on Windows it is likely `C:\`. This is one of several
> ways you might cause a script to break because a file path is configured
> differently than your script anticipates. A workaround for this is to use 
> R packages like [here](https://cran.r-project.org/package=here)
> and [file.path](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.4.3/topics/file.path)
> which allow you to specify file paths in a way that is mostly operating system
> independent. See Jenny Bryan's [blog post](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) for this
> and other R tips.

### Using functions in R, without needing to master them

A **function** in R (or any computing language) is a short
program that takes some input and returns some output. Functions may seem 
like an advanced topic (and they are), but you have already
used at least one function in R. `getwd()` is a function! The next sections 
will help you understand what is happening in any R script.

You have hopefully noticed a pattern - an R
function has three key properties:
- Functions have a **name** (e.g. `dir`, `getwd`); note that functions are case
  sensitive!
- Following the name, functions have a pair of **parentheses** **`()`**
- Inside the parentheses, a function may take 0 or more **arguments**

An **argument** may be a specific input for your function and/or may modify the
function's behavior. For example the function `round()` will round a number
with a decimal:

```
 # This function will round a number to the nearest integer
round(3.14)
[1] 3
```

### Getting help with function arguments

What if you wanted to round to one significant digit? `round()` can
do this, but you may first need to read the help to find out how. To see the help
(In R sometimes also called a "vignette") enter a **`?`** in front of the function
name:

```
?round()
```

The "Help" tab (in the RStudio "Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer" window) 
will show you information (often, too much information) 
on "Rounding of Numbers". You will slowly learn how to read and make 
sense of help files. The "Usage" or "Examples"
headings are often a good place to look first. If you look under the 
"Arguments" heading you also see what arguments can be passed to this 
function to modify its behavior. Alternately, 
you can also see the arguments for any function using the `args()` function:

```
args(round)
function (x, digits = 0) 
NULL
```

Using `args()` we see that `round()` takes two arguments; `x`, which is the number 
to be rounded, and a `digits` argument. Something to remember is that when 
the `args()` function gives you an `=` sign it indicates that a default 
(in this case 0) is already set. R will use the default value 0 unless you 
explicitly provide a different value. *(We can ignore the NULL for now. It 
is returned because `x` doesn't "officially" have a default value.)* 
But it will use `digits = 0` as a default. After providing `x`, we can 
explicitly set the `digits` parameter when we call the `round()` function:

```
round(3.14159, digits = 2)
[1] 3.14
```

To make things easier, R accepts what are called **"positional arguments"**. If you 
give arguments **separated by commas**, R assumes the arguments are in the same 
order as when you used `args()`. In the case below that means that `x` is 3.14159 and
digits is 2 (the same as if you used `digits = 2`).

```
round(3.14159, 2)
[1] 3.14
```

What happens if you are using `?` to get help for a function not installed on your 
system? Here's an example:    

```
?geom_point()
```

will return an error:

~~~
Error in .helpForCall(topicExpr, parent.frame()) :
   no methods for â€˜geom_pointâ€™ and no documentation for it as a function
~~~

Use two question marks (i.e. `??geom_point()`) and R will use
the "Help" tab and return results from a search of all package documentation
you have installed on your computer. Finally, if you think there
should be a function, for example a statistical test, but you aren't
sure what it is called in R, use the "Help" tab search box.

#### More on finding things later
We will discuss more on where to look for the libraries and packages that 
contain functions you want to use. For now, be aware that two important ones 
are [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) - the main repository for R, 
and [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) - a popular repository for 
bioinformatics-related R packages.

### RStudio contextual help

Here is one last bonus we will mention about RStudio. It's difficult to
remember all of the arguments and definitions associated with a given function.
When you start typing the name of a function and hit the <KBD>Tab</KBD> key,
RStudio will display functions and associated help:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/fig/studio_contexthelp1.png)

Once you type a function, hitting the <KBD>Tab</KBD> while the cursor is 
inside the parentheses will show you the function's arguments and 
use the arrow keys to provide additional help for each of the arguments.

### On to R Genomics
Now that we have our RStudio script running, we can begin the process of 
manipulating data using R. The semester is getting old, but our [next lesson]({{ site.baseurl }}/lectures/R-basics-R/) will be very new!

Start of UF scripts

Create a new folder for today's scripts

### Basic expressions

* Write code directly in the interpreter
* Kangaroo rat weight (g -> lb)

```
50
50 / 1000
50 / 1000 * 2.2
```

* Write code in text editor and run either by line or all code

```
50
50 / 1000
50 / 1000 * 2.2
```

* `Source` vs `Source with Echo`

> Create notes R script, put in new folder


### Variables

* A variable is a name that has a value associated with it
    * Assign using `<-` or `=`

```
weight_g <- 50
```

* It works just like the value itself

```
weight_g / 1000
weight_g / 1000 * 2.2
weight_lb = weight_g / 1000 * 2.2
```

* It won't change unless you assign a new value to it directly

```
weight_g
weight_g * 2
weight_g
weight_g <- 26
weight_g
```

### Comments

* Remember what code is doing
* For humans, not computers
* Use the `#`

```
# Calculate weight of Kangaroo Rat in pounds
```

### Assignments format

* Comment before each problem and each sub-problem
* Make sure result prints out on `Source with echo`

```
# Problem 1

# 1.1
2 + 2

# 1.2
2 - 8

# Problem 2

width = 2
height = 3
length = 1.5
volume = width * height * length
volume
```

### Functions

* A function is a complicated expression.
* Command that returns a value
* Hides the details of how that value is determined.
* Useful - don't want to know how numbers are rounded

```
sqrt(weight_lb)
sqrt(0.11)
```

* A function call is composed of two parts.
    * Name of the function
    * Arguments that the function requires to calculate the value it returns.
    * `sqrt()` is the name of the function, and `0.11` is the argument.

* Functions can take multiple arguments.
    * Round `weight_lb` to one decimal place
    * Typing `round()` shows arguments
    * Number to be rounded and number of digits

```
round(0.11, 1)
round(weight_lb, 1)
```

* Save the output of a function by assigning it to a variable

```
weight_rounded <- round(weight_lb, 1)
weight_rounded
```

> Do [Exercise 4.1-4.3 - Built-in Functions]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Functions-built-in-functions-R/)

* If you don't save the output of a function then there is no way to access it

```
mass_kg <- 0.5163
round(mass_kg, 2)
```

* It is common to forget this when dealing with variables and expect the
  variable to have changed

```
mass_kg
```

### Types

* All values have types

```
str(weight_lb)
str('hello world')
```
