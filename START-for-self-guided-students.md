### Step 1: Make sure we can help!

Check out the [target audience]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/audience) of the course and decide if you will benefit from interacting with these materials. If you are a scientists at any educational level that works with data and you 1) want to learn the basics of programming or 2) want to establish a little more formal programming background and work-flow, then you are likely our target audience. You can find a little more encouragement in our description of [why you should take this course]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/why-should-you-take-this-class/).

### Step 2: Decide your approach to the course.

All you have to do is register and turn in the homework on [CANVAS](https://canvas.okstate.edu/courses/51969/quizzes). 
As a self-guided student you can follow along with the whole course.

* If you do not attend the lectures, please follow the [schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule), which begins with introduction to the [Shell]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/why-shell/), and goes on to include introductions into [R]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/why-r/). Each [assignment]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments) includes materials, and practice [exercises]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises). When possible we provide output files for exercises to give you a hint what your code should accomplish.

### Step 3: Setup your computer

Make sure your computer is [setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/computer-setup).

### Step 4: Give us feedback

Help us make sure you have a good experience by [providing feedback](https://github.com/hoytpr/bioinformatics-semester/issues).

<!--

As a self-guided student you can 1) follow along with the whole course at your own pace or 2) find a couple modules that will be helpful to you in isolation. 

1. If you are following the whole course, we suggest you follow the [schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule), which begins with introduction to the [Shell]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/why-shell/), and goes on to include introductions into [R]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/why-r/). Each [assignment]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments) includes materials, a practice [exercises]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises). When possible we provide output files for exercises to give you a hint what your code should accomplish.

2. If you are interested in just a couple of modules in Shell, R, SQL, or Python the best way to find out the assignment that is best suited to your needs is browsing through the [schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule). 

*If you are interested in the Python material, the [lesson material]({{ site.baseurl }}/materials/) and [assignments]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/) developed in previous iterations of the course are still available, but with less direction.*

*If you are interested in the Python material, the [lesson material]({{ site.baseurl }}/materials/) and [assignments]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/) developed in previous iterations of the course are still available, but with less direction.*
