#### Sending information to a sequencing center: Solution

Types of files and information you have generated:  
- spreadsheet or tabular data with the data from your experiment and what you were measuring for your study
- lab notebook notes about how you conducted those experiments
- spreadsheet or tabular data about the samples you are sending for sequencing. Sequencing centers often have a particular format they need with the name of the sample, a unique identifier (preferably a ***simple name*** or index), DNA concentrations, DNA or RNA purity measurements, and other information.
- lab notebook notes about how you prepared the DNA/RNA for sequencing, 
what type of library you want created (if you didn't make your own), 
and what type of sequencing you're doing, e.g. "paired-end, 
2 x 150bp, Illumina, HiSeq".

There likely will be other files depending on the center requirements.

Was this more information and data than you were expecting?
