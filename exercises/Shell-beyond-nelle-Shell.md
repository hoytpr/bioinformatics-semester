> ### Variables in Shell Scripts
>
> In the `molecules` directory, imagine you have a shell script called `script.sh` containing the
> following commands:
>
> ~~~
> head -n $2 $1
> tail -n $3 $1
> ~~~
>
> While you are in the `molecules` directory, you type the following command:
>
> ~~~
> bash script.sh '*.pdb' 1 1
> ~~~
>
> Which of the following outputs would you expect to see?
>
> 1. All of the lines between the first and the last lines of each file ending in `.pdb`
>    in the `molecules` directory
> 2. The first and the last line of each file ending in `.pdb` in the `molecules` directory
> 3. The first and the last line of each file in the `molecules` directory
> 4. An error because of the quotes around `*.pdb`
>
> > ## Solution
> > The correct answer is 2. 
> >
> > The special variables $1, $2 and $3 represent the command line arguments given to the
> > script, such that the commands run are:
> >
> > ```
> > $ head -n 1 cubane.pdb ethane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb
> > $ tail -n 1 cubane.pdb ethane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb
> > ```
> > {: .language-bash}
> > The shell does not expand `'*.pdb'` because it is enclosed by quote marks.
> > As such, the first argument to the script is `'*.pdb'` which gets expanded within the
> > script by `head` and `tail`.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}


> ## Find the Longest File With a Given Extension
>
> Write a shell script called `longest.sh` that takes the name of a
> directory and a filename extension as its arguments, and prints
> out the name of the file with the most lines in that directory
> with that extension. For example:
>
> ~~~
> $ bash longest.sh /tmp/data pdb
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> would print the name of the `.pdb` file in `/tmp/data` that has
> the most lines.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > ```
> > # Shell script which takes two arguments: 
> > #    1. a directory name
> > #    2. a file extension
> > # and prints the name of the file in that directory
> > # with the most lines which matches the file extension.
> > 
> > wc -l $1/*.$2 | sort -n | tail -n 2 | head -n 1
> > ```
> > {: .source}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Script Reading Comprehension
>
> For this question, consider the `data-shell/molecules` directory once again.
> This contains a number of `.pdb` files in addition to any other files you
> may have created.
> Explain what a script called `example.sh` would do when run as
> `bash example.sh *.pdb` if it contained the following lines:
>
> ~~~
> # Script 1
> echo *.*
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> ~~~
> # Script 2
> for filename in $1 $2 $3
> do
>     cat $filename
> done
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> ~~~
> # Script 3
> echo $@.pdb
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> > ## Solutions
> > Script 1 would print out a list of all files containing a dot in their name.
> >
> > Script 2 would print the contents of the first 3 files matching the file extension.
> > The shell expands the wildcard before passing the arguments to the `example.sh` script.
> > 
> > Script 3 would print all the arguments to the script (i.e. all the `.pdb` files),
> > followed by `.pdb`.
> > ```
> > cubane.pdb ethane.pdb methane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb.pdb
> > ```
> > {: .output}
> {: .solution}
