<!--

1. From Nelle's 
/north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03 directory:

What is a `ls` command with flags and arguments that will output:
(Only the files beginning with `NENE017` and are type `A` sample datafiles?)
NENE01729A.txt  NENE01736A.txt  NENE01751A.txt

2. Use the output from `ls --help` to answer the following question:

From Nelle's /north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03 directory:

What `ls` flag(s) would output the contents of the directory 
by size, with the smallest sized files listed first?

3.  Use the output from `ls --help` to answer the following question:

From Nelle's /north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03 directory:
when you enter the command `ls`, the output is a tabular (https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/tabular) filename output, and changes depending on the size of your terminal window.. You can check this by expanding your terminal window and entering `ls` again. If you enter the command `ls -l` the files will be presented in fixed width "long" tabular format (with several columns of information we haven't talked about). What flag could be used instead to list only the filenames as a single column of names? 

4. Using the course directory structure, 
if Nelle is in her `Desktop/data-shell/creatures` directory, 
which one-line `cd` command will move her to
into the /north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03 directory?
