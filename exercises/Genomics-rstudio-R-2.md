### Working with Dataframes

#### Exercise: Review the arguments of the `read.csv()` function

**Before using the `read.csv()` function, use R's help feature to answer the
following questions**.

*Hint*: Entering '?' before the function name and then running that line will
bring up the help documentation. Also, when reading this particular help
be careful to pay attention to the 'read.csv' expression under the 'Usage'
heading. Other answers will be in the 'Arguments' heading.

A) What is the default parameter for 'header' in the `read.csv()` function?

B) What argument would you have to change to read a file that was delimited
by semicolons (;) rather than commas?

C) What argument would you have to change to read file in which numbers
used commas for decimal separation (i.e. 1,00)?

D) What argument would you have to change to read in only the first 10,000 rows
of a very large file?
