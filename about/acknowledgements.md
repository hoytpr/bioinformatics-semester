#### Primary Contributors

Although this course is taught at OSU by [Dr. Peter R. Hoyt](http://biochemistry.okstate.edu/faculty/dr.-peter-hoyt-1), the original course materials and website 
design have been primarily developed and
implemented by [Ethan White](http://ethanwhite.org) and [Zachary Brym](http://zackbrym.weecology.org/) in cooperation with [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/). See our [contributors page](https://github.com/datacarpentry/semester-biology/graphs/contributors) for more 
details. More recent genomics lessons were developed with tremendous effort by [volunteer experts](https://github.com/datacarpentry/organization-genomics/graphs/contributors) and [others](https://github.com/datacarpentry/wrangling-genomics/graphs/contributors) and [more](https://github.com/datacarpentry/shell-genomics/graphs/contributors) who should be appreciated. There may be some contributors not mentioned, and if they contact me I'll gladly add their names or links to this list.

#### Funding

The development of this course, and this site, have been supported by the Gordon
and Betty Moore Foundation's Data-Driven Discovery Initiative through grants
[GBMF4563](https://www.moore.org/grants/list/GBMF4563) and [GBMF4855](https://www.moore.org/grants/list/GBMF4855), and by an [NSF CAREER award](http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0953694). As this curricula becomes more diverse it will be difficult to maintain a list of all funding sources, but we will try. 

#### The Carpentries

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) Are an organization that teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. The Carpentries teach foundational coding, and data science skills to researchers worldwide. Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry workshops are based on our lessons. Workshop hosts, Instructors, and learners must be prepared to follow our [Code of Conduct](http://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html). We are a diverse, global community of volunteers. Our community includes [Instructors](https://carpentries.org/instructors/), helpers, Trainers, [Maintainers](https://carpentries.org/maintainers/), Mentors, community champions, member organisations, supporters, workshop organisers, staff and a whole lot more.

#### Data Carpentry

[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) is a web and workshop based organization that is designed to teach 
basic computing concepts, skills, and tools for working with scientific data. 
The resources provided on this site are being developed in association with Data 
Carpentry.

#### Software Carpentry

[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) has been teaching scientists and engineers the concepts, skills, 
and tools they need to use and build software more productively since 1977. All 
of the content is freely available under a Creative Commons license (the same 
one we use here), and the existence of this content not only saves me a massive 
amount of time and effort, but also taught me a lot of what I know about 
programming well.

#### Infrastructure

The site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme from [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) 
and icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) by Dave Gandy.
