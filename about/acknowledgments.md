#### Primary Contributors

Although this course is taught at OSU by [Dr. Peter R. Hoyt](http://biochemistry.okstate.edu/faculty/dr.-peter-hoyt-1), the original course materials and website 
design have been primarily developed and
implemented by [Ethan White](http://ethanwhite.org) and [Zachary Brym](http://zackbrym.weecology.org/) in cooperation with [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/). See our [contributors page](https://github.com/datacarpentry/semester-biology/graphs/contributors) for more 
details. More recent genomics lessons from the Carpentries were developed thanks to 
[genomics data experts](https://github.com/datacarpentry/organization-genomics/graphs/contributors) 
, [genomics wrangling experts](https://github.com/datacarpentry/wrangling-genomics/graphs/contributors) 
and [shell experts](https://github.com/datacarpentry/shell-genomics/graphs/contributors) who should 
be appreciated. You can cite the material used in this course using the follwing DOI:

Annotations indicating specific contributors are scattered throughout the 
lessons, but there are inevitably some contributors not mentioned, and if they contact me 
I'll gladly add their names or links to this list. The curricula are made available through

#### Philosophy

This particular course by Dr. Hoyt emphasizes making the curricula more 
understandable for a specific target
audience of Life Scientists, who are
**truly beginners**, and who want or need
to be better. To strive toward this 
goal Dr. Hoyt will embrace The Carpentries active learning pedagogy and continue to
improve the course through practices of education experts including 
[Dr. Rochelle Tractenberg](https://cbpr.georgetown.edu/rochelle_tractenberg/#)
who developed the [Mastery Rubric for Bioinformatics](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/655456v1) [published in PlOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0225256) 
and described in an [interview](https://lifescitrainers.org/2019/06/25/bioinformatics-mastery-rubric-interview-with-rochelle-tractenberg/)
by [Jason Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-williams-52847233) on the 
[Life Science Trainers website](https://lifescitrainers.org). See also her [poster](https://f1000research.com/posters/8-1160) and [slides](https://f1000research.com/slides/8-1161) 
from ISMB/ECCB 2019 availble through [F1000](https://f1000research.com/) and [The GOBLET Foundation](https://www.mygoblet.org/).
 
#### Diversity
Oklahoma State University is proudly committed to promoting diversity and 
inclusion within higher education. This course follows those proud commitments. 
For more information inclusion and diversity awards, enrollment, and resources, 
please read about [OSU's Institutional Diversity Office](https://diversity.okstate.edu/).
The Vice President for Institutional Diversity and Chief Diversity Officer at OSU 
is [Dr. Jason F. Kirksey](https://diversity.okstate.edu/dr-jason-f-kirksey). 

#### Funding

Dr. Hoyt is generously supported by the 
[Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](http://biochemistry.okstate.edu/) and 
the [Office of the Vice President for Research](https://research.okstate.edu/) at 
[Oklahoma State University](https://go.okstate.edu/). 
The initial development of this course, was supported by the Gordon
and Betty Moore Foundation's Data-Driven Discovery Initiative through grants
to Ethan White [GBMF4563](https://www.moore.org/grants/list/GBMF4563) and [GBMF4855](https://www.moore.org/grants/list/GBMF4855), and by an [NSF CAREER award](http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0953694). 
As these curricula become more diverse it will be difficult to maintain a 
list of all funding sources, but we will try. 

#### The Carpentries

Dr. Hoyt and [OSU](http://info.library.okstate.edu/c.php?g=902101) participate in The Carpentries community. 
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) are an organization that teaches foundational 
coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. Software Carpentry, 
Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry workshops are based on our lessons. 
To participate you are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](http://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html). 
We are a diverse, global community of volunteers. Our community includes 
[Instructors](https://carpentries.org/instructors/), helpers, Trainers, 
[Maintainers](https://carpentries.org/maintainers/), Mentors, community champions, 
member organisations, supporters, workshop organisers, staff and a whole lot more.

#### Data Carpentry

[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) is a web and workshop based organization 
that is designed to teach basic computing concepts, skills, and tools for working 
with scientific data. The resources provided on this site are being developed 
in association with Data Carpentry.

#### Software Carpentry

[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) has been teaching scientists and engineers the concepts, skills, 
and tools they need to use and build software more productively since 1977. All 
of the content is freely available under a Creative Commons license (the same 
one we use here). The existence of this content saves me a massive 
amount of time and effort, and inspired me to show other Life Scientists that 
programming knowledge is essential, and that programming well is achievable.

#### Infrastructure

The site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme from [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) 
and icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) by Dave Gandy.
