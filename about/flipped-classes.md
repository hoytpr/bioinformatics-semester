title: Flipped Classes
---

It's very easy to use a flipped, learner-centered, approach to teaching both of
these classes. Ethan White designed them assuming learning to program has very little
to do with someone talking and a lot to do with students working on
computers. Flipped classes work well for all kinds of content, but 
they work particularly well for computer oriented classes.
