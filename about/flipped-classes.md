title: Flipped Classes
---

It's very easy to use a flipped, learner-centered, approach to teaching
these classes. Ethan White originally designed them assuming learning to program has 
very little to do with someone talking and a lot to do with students working on
computers. Flipped classes work well for all kinds of content, but 
they work particularly well for computer oriented classes. 

The challenges to convert Workshops to weekly classes should prove entertaining.
