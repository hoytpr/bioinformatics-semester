title: Why R?
---

This course is designed to flow into learning the computer language R. There are 
other great computer languages like Python or Perl, but we chose R because it has a 
statistical structure and plotting capability that we hope will be immediately 
useful to a life scientist.


1.  R is used widely in a number of disciplines, like ecology, and provides a  
    solid platform for beginner scientific programmers. Many graphing and 
    statistical operations are built right into the language.
2.  It is a broadly useful and powerful language. This means that you should 
    be able to do almost anything you want to do using R, and it should 
    be relatively easy to accomplish.
3.  It's free. Funding rates for scientific research are extremely low
    at the moment and this means that expensive software licenses are
    often untenable, especially for students conducting their own
    research. This also allows students in the class to program without 
    dealing with licensing hassles, and
    guarantees that anyone can take advantage of the online resources
    that are being developed.
4.  It runs on all major operating systems.
5.  At Oklahoma State, It provides a useful introduction to Dr. Charles Chen's 
    (and others) OMICS curricula.
6.  It is used by many scientific programmers and taught in many research
    science departments. This makes collaborating with experts
    on large or complex projects much easier.
7.  [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org) and [Software Carpentry](http://softwarecarpentry.org) 'lecture' materials are available
    in R, which provides a resource for students to learn more
    advanced topics *on their own* and presents these topics in 
	slightly different 'perspectives' for different types
	of learners.  It's also easy to contribute material back to Data 
    Carpentry and Software Carpentry.
8.  [R is the most common statistics platform in Ecology](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.1394/abstract).
