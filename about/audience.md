The goals of this site and its lessons are to help students begin, learn, and then
succeed in using data science practices within a Life Science background.
The lessons are designed to be used whether a student thrives
in a classroom setting at a college or university; or whether the student is
more free-range... a self-motivated learner. The lessons can be used for 
students to learn on-line and on their own pace (except for the homework) 
but are also good for students that want the feedback and fluency that comes
with active learning. The course works when offered in a classroom or online. 
Instructors and participants will continue to build and share the material, making
it maximally useful to the broader audience of biologists who want to
learn how to use programming and bioinformatics software. We are
committed to helping folks who are complete beginners, and welcome those who
already have some programming background.

Examples of who we are trying to help include:

**Allen:** An undergraduate student in a biology related field who
either realizes that computers are going to be important in whatever
area of biology he ends up working or likes computers and thinks
learning about them be more fun than the other available electives. He
has never programmed before and doesn't really know what a database is.

**Jenny:** A graduate student with a background in doing hands on
biology either in the lab or the field. Now that she's in graduate
school she's realized that managing the data she's collecting in a
reasonable way is going to be important (working with the hodge podge of
poorly structured spreadsheets that her lab uses is awful), and doing
all of the analysis that she needs to conduct for her dissertation seems
like it would be a lot easier if it could be automated.

**Paul:** A faculty member with little computer background who knows
that computing has become central to his area of research and he
needs to have a rough idea of how his students are working the programming
magic they do for projects. Even better he'd
like to get to the point where he can really engage and help out.
