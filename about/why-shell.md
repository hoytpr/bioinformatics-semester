title: Why Shell
---

Teaching the Shell is a critical first part of learning 
about everything that comes later whether accessing high
performance computers, or learning how to script and code. 
The best part? It's kind of fun!

1.  It is underappreciated as perhaps the basic process language that is used across the
    breadth of biological computing. As the first part of accessing supercomputers, 
	or the cloud, it is utilized by pretty much everyone. 
2.  We all know **graphical user interfaces** (GUI): 
    They have windows, icons and pointers. They are easy to learn and 
	fantastic for tasks where a vocabulary consisting of 
	"click" translates easily into "do the thing I want". But 
	this magic relies on wanting a predefined and relatively simple 
    set of things, and the GUI must display all those things, and 
	have programs to do exactly those things. 
3.  To do complex, purpose-specific things it helps 
    to have a richer set of instructions to express to the 
	computer. It doesn't need to be complicated or difficult, just 
	a vocabulary of commands and grammar rules for using them.
4.  This is what the shell provides - a simple language and a 
    **command-line interface** to use it through.
