title: Why Shell
---

Teaching the Shell is a critical first part of learning 
about everything that comes later in both access to high
performance computers, and how to script and code. 
The best part? It's kind of fun!

1.  It is the basic process language that is used across the
    breadth of biology. As the first part of accessing supercomputers, 
	it is utilized by pretty much everyone. 
2.  We are all familiar with **graphical user interfaces** (GUI): 
    windows, icons and pointers. They are easy to learn and 
	fantastic for simple tasks where a vocabulary consisting of 
	"click" translates easily into "do the thing I want". But 
	this magic relies on wanting a simple set of things, and 
	having programs that can do exactly those things. 
3.  If you wish to do complex, purpose-specific things it helps 
    to have a richer means of expressing your instructions to the 
	computer. It doesn't need to be complicated or difficult, just 
	a vocabulary of commands and a simple grammar for using them.
4.  This is what the shell provides - a simple language and a 
    **command-line interface** to use it through.
