Assignment under development

**Data Wrangling** is often considered 90% of bioinformatics

Why? Because data and technology grew faster than standards could be
developed. This resulted hundreds of file formats
that are specific for a particular bioinformatics software package.

On top of that, proprietary software (e.g. Excel) became the most popular package used to
collect data. In an effort to please the majority of userss, some formatting rules 
with proprietary software causes problems for bioinformatics software. 
These exercises are only showing you a few formats and a few problmes, but 
they are some of most well-known, and will help you see how you can 
reformat files using simple shell commands.
