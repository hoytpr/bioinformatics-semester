We will use the "Quiz" functions on Canvas to turn in assignments, exercises, reports, or any homework. **NOTE:** There will always be different links to quizzes for different lectures. 

The "Quiz" function allows for the best flexibility on Canvas. If ever an assignment does NOT use the "Quiz" function on Canvas, you will be notified.
