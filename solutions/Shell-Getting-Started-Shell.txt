#### Solution to Exercise 4

The `-l` flag makes `ls` use a **l**ong listing format, showing not only
the file/directory names but also additional information such as the file size
and the time of its last modification. If you use both the `-h` flag and the `-l` flag,
this makes the file size "**h**uman readable", i.e. displaying something like `5.3K` 
instead of `5369`.
