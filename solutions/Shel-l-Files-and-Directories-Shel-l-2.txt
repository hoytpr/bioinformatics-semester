We start in the `/Users/nelle/data` directory, and create a new folder called `recombine`.
The second line moves (`mv`) the file `proteins.dat` to the new folder (`recombine`).
The third line makes a copy of the file we just moved.  The tricky part here is where the file was
copied to.  Recall that `..` means "go up a level", so the copied file is now in `/Users/nelle`.
Notice that `..` is interpreted with respect to the current working
directory, *not* with respect to the location of the file being copied.
So, the only thing that will show using ls (in `/Users/nelle/data`) is the recombine folder.

1. No, see explanation above.  `proteins-saved.dat` is located at `/Users/nelle`
2. Yes
3. No, see explanation above.  `proteins.dat` is located at `/Users/nelle/data/recombine`
4. No, see explanation above.  `proteins-saved.dat` is located at `/Users/nelle`
