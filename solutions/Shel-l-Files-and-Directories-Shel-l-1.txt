Q: In the example below, what does `cp` do when given several filenames and a directory name?

$ mkdir backup
$ cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt backup/

A: If given more than one file name followed by a directory name (i.e. the destination directory must 
be the last argument), `cp` copies the files to the named directory.

Q: In the example below, what does `cp` do when given three or more file names?

$ ls -F
amino-acids.txt  animals.txt  backup/  elements/  morse.txt  pdb/  planets.txt  salmon.txt  sunspot.txt
$ cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt morse.txt 

A: If given three file names, `cp` throws an error because it is expecting a directory
name as the last argument.

cp: target ‘morse.txt’ is not a directory
